Robotics Cape Library Installer 

For BeagleBone Black and BeagleBone Blue running Debian Jessie.

Installation instructions and user manual can be found here:

Andrewiski GitHub Changed include changed to avoid Pin conflict on the BBGW.  

Note that phyicaly you can not use the Robotics Cape on BBGW the USB headers are in the way I am only reusing the library.

What is lost from Beagle Bone Black Wireless to Beagle Bone Green is as follows.

Motor Encoder 2 and PRU Encoder 0 leaving only two motor encoders working Encoder 0 and Encoder 1
No SPI is avalible on BBGW as used by BBGW Bluetooth
No Motor Standby Pin used to enable the BBGW 
No Battery LEDS in conflict with the WIFI data transfer.
Had to move MDIR1A to pin P8_31  #define MDIR1A_BBGW 10  //gpio0.10  P8_31

Sheet 0 BBGW schematic. (https://github.com/SeeedDocument/BeagleBone_Green_Wireless/blob/master/resources/BeagleBone_Green%20Wireless_V1.0_SCH_20160314.pdf )
The pins on the sheet with 3,9 means page 3 and 9, page 9 is 40 pin headers and are in conflict . 
Having Conflicts on MDIR_1A means I am down to 3 motors but I remapped MDIR_1A on BBGW to Pin in software to a different open pin so I still have 4 motors. I think P8_31 and P8_32 are open Uart5 CTS/RTS.

Updated List of Conflict Pins that I found are as follows
Pin BBWG Robotics Cape
P8_11 WL_SDIO_D1 QEB2B
P8_12 WL_SDIO_D0 QEB2A
P8_14 WL_EN BAT_LED_4
P8_15 WL_SDIO_D3 PRU_ENC_A
P8_16 WL_SDIO_D2 PRU_ENC_B
P8_17 WL_IRQ BATT_LED_1
P8_18 WL_SDIO_CLK BATT_LED_2
P8_26 WL_Level_Shifter_OE BATT_LED_3
P9_12 BT_EN MDIR_1A
P9_28 BT_AUD_IN SPI1_CS0
P9_29 BT_AUD_FSYNC SPI1_D0
P9_30 BT_AUD_OUT SPI1_D1

P9_41 WL_SLOW_CLK MOT_STBY
